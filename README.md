# AlzheimeR

A Microsoft Hololens assistive technology, AlzheimeR provides a rich set of features to restore functionality in the household for those who suffer from dementia and other memory loss related diseases.

Over the past couple days we built an app to help caretakers track the onset of dementia in their patients. We mimicked an existing experimental design that is used today with physical objects laying around a room. After observing the room, the patient is asked questions about the objects placed and evaluated for accuracy.

Using Hololens, we can save doctors time and help them administer tests in the exact same configuration months later to track progress.
